Out of the trev tutor videos, the recursion video helped the most. I wasnt able to under stand you allowed
for simply using the factorial for the towers of Hanoi assignment, but if it had been simply to demonstrate
the usage of recursion then that made sense and allowed to me to continue. Additionally the loop via recursion
was also a nice example. However I still dont quite understand the benefits of a recursion loop over a while 
or for loop.
